# _ccmjs_ Technology

The "Client-side Component Model" (_ccmjs_) is a technology to expand the functionality of the web.
Component developers can develop their own <i>ccmjs</i>-based web components and put them on the web as free software.
Everyone can then use the components to design any webpage area.
The functionality of a component can be adapted via its configuration and
components can be combined to form larger applications.
_ccmjs_ also offers services for loading resources and data management.
